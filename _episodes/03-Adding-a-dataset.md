## Including a dataset to the CAP entry

Now that we have created our first CAP entry in the previous lesson, let's add some useful information to it. One of the first things someone accessing your preserved analysis will want to know, is which dataset you used when perfoming your analysis.
For this, we are going to learn how to append this information!

So we will now need to perfom some actions:

1. In the menu on your left, click on Input Data
2. Click on Primary Datasets to include some real data dataset
~~~
Add the following dataset: FIXME
~~~
{: .language-yaml}
3. Click on Monte Carlo Signal Datasets to include some dataset simulation on the signal model your are using
~~~
Add the following dataset: FIXME
~~~
{: .language-yaml}
4. Click on Monte Carlo Background Datasts to include some dataset simulation on the background you are using
~~~
Add the following dataset: FIXME
~~~
{: .language-yaml}





## Exporting the datasets as a Latex file
