## Connecting the CAP with your favourite repository

We have already created a new CAP entry and added some dataset paths and triggers. We may want to include now some code from your favourite repository, containing the workflow of your analysis.
It is possible to connect an external account (Github, CERN Gitlab, ORCiD, Zenodo. . . ) with the CAP account, to automate tasks and content submission. One can just add the current repository content from the tarball or create a connection (webhook) so that everytime

Let's try it out using your CERN Gitlab account! (FIXME: or you prefer to use Github?)

For this you have to follow these steps:
