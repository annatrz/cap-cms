## Including a trigger path to the CAP entry

Now that we have created our first CAP entry and included some input datasets, let's also add some trigger paths. Let's see how to include this information!

1. In the menu on your left, click again on Input Data
2. Click on Primary Datasets and then on the dataset sample you added in the last lesson. 
3. Click on the + sign in the trigger section.  
4. You can now add a trigger path. Start typing to see how the autocomplete feature does its job!

Add the following trigger path: FIXME
~~~
{: .language-yaml}





## Searching an entry by trigger

Now that you have included the trigger information, you can test the search functionalities!

Go to the `Search` area on the top of the CAP portal, and search for all the drafts containing the trigger path you just included! Among all the entries, you will see the analysis your have just created!

## Searching an entry by dataset and trigger
Try now to narrow down your search by looking for entries having the primary dataset AND the trigger path you have included
