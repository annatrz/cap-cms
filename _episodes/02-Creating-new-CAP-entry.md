## Overall view

After the introduction showing the general aspects of the CAP portal, it's now time to create a new CAP entry so that we can really see how the whole workflow works.

When entering in the portal, you will have available all the information on your preserved analyses (that right now should be 0) and all the analyses preserved by people in your collaboration. Also, a summary of the main tags is included in the `QUICK SEARCH` word map. If you click on one of this words, like for instance `EXO`, you will see the list with all the CAP entries in the EXOTICA group that have already been preserved.

You will also see a place holder to include your `WORKFLOWS`. Once you have your code preserved and some associated workflow, you will be able to launch it directly from CAP.

## Start preserving

Let's now preserve your own analysis! 

When inside of the CAP portal you can go directly to `CREATE`. A prompt will appear asking you about the title for the analysis to be preserved and the type of content you want to preserve. On the latter you should select CMS Analysis. For a title pick something that will help you to easily find your analysis among the others, e.g `Search for H -> WW -> 2l 2nu`. And `Start Preserving`!

## Basic information

Congratulations, you just made a first step! You can see that form consists a lot of sections, where you can provide some extra information about your analysis. Any piece of information is extremely useful - it will make your analysis easily searchable and reproducible in the future.

The first section is a `Basic Information`. If your analysis has already assigned `CADI ID`, we can fetch some information for you. Try to put an example CADI_ID, like `HIG-10-003`. Now check an `Information from CADI database` section. This information will be saved with your analysis, so you can search data from two systems in one place. That easy!
