# Entering in the CAP portal

The CAP portal can be accessed [here](https://analysispreservation.cern.ch/) with your CERN account.

#Overall overview

After the introduction showing the general aspects of the CAP portal, it's now time to create a new CAP entry so that we can really see how the whole workflow works.

 When entering you will have available all the information on your preserved analyses (that right now should be 0) and all the analyses preserved by people in your collaboration. Also, a summary of the main tags is included in the QUICK SEARCH word map. If you click on one of this words, like for instance EXO, you will see the list with all the CAP entries in the EXOTICA group that have already been preserved. 

You will also see a place holder to include your WORKFLOWS. Once you have your code preserved and some associated workflow, you will be able to launch it directly from CAP.
