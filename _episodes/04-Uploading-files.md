## Uploading files

CAP encourages you to store all important pieces of information, that are valuable for your analysis. Those can be instructions, plots, tables, documentations, presentations - basically everything that you find useful for your work. To make this happen, each analysis has its `file manager` . In the editor view, you can see it on the right side of the screen. Let's try to use it to attach some file to your analysis!

1. Click `+` button
2. Drag and drop file from your disk
3. Done, file was saved in your analysis!

Uploaded file is now safely stored within your analysis.
