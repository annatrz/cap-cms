The CERN analysis preservation effort pursuits the goal to describe and structure the knowledge behing the physics analyses aiming for its future reuse.

* Describe all assets of an analysis
* Track information provenance
* Ensure sufficient documentation
* Capture associated links

The CERN analysis preservation portal (CAP) comprises a set of tools and services aiming to assist researchers in describing and preserving all the components of a physics analysis such as data, software and computing environment. Together with the associated documentation, all these assets are kept in one place so that the analysis can be fully or partially reused even several years after the publication of the original scientific results. An experiment specific submission and retrieval interface has been developed for the CMS collaboration. It integrates with the CMS internal analysis registry (CADI) to capture all analyses with basic information, complemented with a detailed submission form for full information. The CMS data aggregation system (DAS) is interfaced to the deposit form to assist in filling in exact dataset names used in the analysis to ensure searchability. 


The CAP portal effort is run by CERN Scientific Information Services with the help from the different experiments. The portal is still in beta phase, but already providing many useful functionalities. In this tutorial we are going to walk through the available features!

Let's start!
