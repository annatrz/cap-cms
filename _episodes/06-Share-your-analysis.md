## Share an analysis

We are now going to share the CAP entry we have created. For this, you can click on the Sharing icon on the left menu.

When you click you will be asked about how to share the information. If you decide to publish it, it will create a versioned snapshot of the record and make it available to the CMS members within CAP portal. You can also decide which permissions to assign, by email or by CERN e-group.
